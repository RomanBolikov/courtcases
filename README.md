# courtcases
This is a desktop app written in Java via Spring Boot and JavaFX with the aid of Rene Gielen's FxWeaver project.
It's a pet project not meant for any production but is actually used by my department at work (to make thing a LOT easier).
It maintains an SQL database with court cases that my department works with 
(in the actual version it uses MariaDB, but this is a demo version with a built-in H2 database).
All data inserted in sample database is fictional (except my own name), so all similarities between this data and reality are entirely coincidental
and not related to any real person or company.
You may use parts of this code as you wish with no resctrictions. Questions are welcome via my email roman.a.bolikov@gmail.com
